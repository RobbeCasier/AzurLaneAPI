# AzurLaneAPI
## Introduction
Welcome to my implementation on the AzurAPI: https://azurapi.github.io/#introduction  
This project started as an assignment given by my University (Howest Kortrijk Belgium) where I attend the course DAE - Game Development. Where I had to chose an API to work on.  
My knowledge of this environment is still low, but I hope the end this project with good quality code and a nice looking interface.  

## Description
Here I will show the current things that can be done.
- Search through all available ships on the English Server (with exclusion of a few Collabs ships)

## My TODO list
- Add ships to your list
- List is local safe file
- Be able to change lv
- Be able to change stats
- Be able to set Marriage (taking stats into account)
- Be able to set retrofit
- Be able to set your current owned skins and the current selected one
- Power calculator
- Account tab (here you can set your ID and your profile picture to one of your collected ships), will have you collection ratio
The hardest one:
- List of all Equipments
- Add to your list
- Local safe file
- change lv (has impact on stats)
- set your ship with the fitting equipment
